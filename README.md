# FormalAspects

This repository contains two projects made for two mandatory assignments for the course of Formal Aspects of Software Engineering. 

Both of them are dealing with the establishment of formal specification for two different problem descriptions. 
The first one is dealing with the well-known Four color theorem, the second one discusses a model for checking time tables and tram nets.

These projects are so based on informal description and requirement specification, which have been implemented into a RSL executable program using the tool eRAISE.
These programs have been then translated to SML in order to obtain results for tests which are available in the folders as *.sml.results files.
